**1\. [ 40 points ] Consider a lined sheet of paper that is ruled with equally spaced parrallel lines of distance 1. Suppose a needle of length $\ell$ is randomly dropped on the paper. Let $X$ be the distance from the midpoint of the needle to the nearest line and $Y$ be the shortest incline angle of the needle from the line perpendicular to the parallel lines, as illustrated below.**

**Because the needle is randomly dropped on the paper, we assume that $X\sim\text{Unif}(0,\dfrac{1}{2})$ and $Y\sim\text{Unif}(0,\dfrac{\pi}{2})$, and $X$ and $Y$ are independent. When $X\sim\text{Unif}(a,b)$, the probability density function (pdf) of $X$ is given by $f_{X}(x)=1/(b-a)$ for $a<x<b$ and $0$ otherwise.**



**(a) [ 10 points ] When $$\ell<1$$, show that the event $$\left\{ X<\dfrac{\ell\cos Y}{2}\right\}$$  is equivalent to the event that the needle comes to lie in a position where it intersects one of the parallel lines.** 

**(b) [ 10 points ] When $\ell<1$, calculate the probability of the needle crossing one of the parallel lines on the paper.**

**(c) [ 10 points ] When $\ell\ge1$, find a condition of $Y$ such that the needle always crosses one of the parallel lines on the paper, and calculate the corresponding probability.**

**(d) [ 10 points ] When $\ell\ge1$, calculate the probability of the needle crossing one of the parallel lines on the paper, using the fact that $\sin\left(\arccos x\right)=\sqrt{1-x^{2}}$.**
